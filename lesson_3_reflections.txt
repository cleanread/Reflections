Question 1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer 1
When you are collaborating with other users
When you might use multiple machines
When you care about backing up your work

Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer 2
Pulling changes may result in merge conflicts or unusable code if you still haven't finished the functionality that you are building locally

Question 3
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer 3
Forks clone a repository directly on GitHub. They would be useful when you are planning from splitting from the source and don't intend for your changes to be merged back into the origin.
Clones copy a repository from Git or GitHub to your local system. They are useful when you want to make multiple versions of the same software.
Branches create a new commit path in the same repo. They are useful when performing work with the intent to merge it into master.
