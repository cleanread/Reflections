Question 1
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer 1
When you are collaborating with other users
When you might use multiple machines
When you care about backing up your work

Question 2
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer 2
Pulling changes may result in merge conflicts or unusable code if you still haven't finished the functionality that you are building locally
