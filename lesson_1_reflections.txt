Question 1
How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Answer 1
It only presented sections of the code where there were differences.

I only had to scan and compare small amounts of code instead of the entire document.

Question 2
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Answer 2
Version history helps you find when bugs were introduced and either revert to the old version or debug based on the old code.

Also, functions and code that becomes depracated may later prove useful.

Question 3
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Answer 3
Git
+ Control over commits
+ Logical increments
+ Allows logging details about commit
- Prone to human error
- Prone to machine error

Google Docs
+ Saves immediately
- No logical grouping of changes (date based)
- Can create too many instances with no reasons logged

Question 4
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Answer 4
Git allows multiple files because a single logical change to a function might require updated several files.
Google Docs is not likely to see similarly dependencies between files.

Question 5
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Answer 5
Git log shows the commit history with comments. Use this to identify the commits to be compared. Then copy the commit IDs into git diff to view the differences.

Question 6
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Answer 6
I would be much more likely to try new things including removing functions.

I wouldn't rely so much on commenting out unused code just in case it might be useful in the future.

Question 7
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Answer 7
Games. Web sites. Anything.
